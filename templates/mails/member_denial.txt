Hi,

This mail is sent to you to tell you that you are currently no member of the Pirate Party in Belgium, at least not to our records.
If this would be incorrect, please let us know by replying to this mail! You might have been registered using a different mail address.

It is possible that you once were a member of the Pirate Party, but the last payment of your membership fee is than probably over a year ago.
If this is a mistake, you may still correct this by paying any amount (>â‚¬1) to the Pirate Party (BE90 5230 8062 2132). This way, you won't only become a member of the party again, but you also help the party enormously. 
In the Pirate Party, we are all volunteers and the only income we have are the membership fees. Any voluntary contribution helps us moving forward enormously.

If you happen to forget about this regularly, might we advice to set up an automatic small payment each month at your bank? This is also because a regular steady gift makes managing finances in the party easier than a gift in yearly spikes.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

The Finance Squad
Pirate Party Belgium
