Hello pirate,

You used to be a member of the Pirate Party, but the last payment of your membership fee is now over a year ago. This means you are no longer a member of the party.

If this is a mistake, you may still correct this by paying any amount (>â‚¬1) to the Pirate Party. This way, you won't only become a member of the party again, but you also help the party enormously. 
In the Pirate Party, we are all volunteers and the only income we have are the membership fees.

If you happen to forget about this regularly, might we advice to set up an automatic small payment each month at your bank? For a regular steady gift makes managing finances in the party easier than a gift in yearly spikes.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours sincerely,

The finance squad
